  "summary": "Object is the root class in Julian\u0027s typing system. All classes are derived from Object.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe class-based typing system in Julian is foundamentally analogous to that of Java/C#. It only supports single-inheritance so that a class can only have one parent class. If no such parent is specified in the delcaration, Object is used by default. A class, however, can have unlimited number of interfaces. Similarly,  an interface can also extend zero or more interfaces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe method calling supports dynamic dispatching. The exact method to be called is dependent on the current runtime type. This can be illustrated by a classical example. Say we have class C and P, where C extends P. Then in the following code snippet,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[code]\nP p \u003d new C();\np.fun();[code: end] what is being really called is implementation of fun() in C, should C have really re-implemented that method.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe members of a class can be categorized to static and non-static, a.k.a. instance-based. Static members can and should be be called from the class itself, while an instance-based member can only be called against the instance. Within the instance method body, one can refer to members of this class by \u0027this\u0027, and those of parent classes by \u0027super\u0027. Recall, again, that such references are dynamically dispatched, so it\u0027s impossible to specify the member provided by a certain ancestor along the inheritance chain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew instances of an Object can be created by \u0027new\u0027 operator, which is followed by a constructor call. A constructor may also call other constructors, which can be referenced by either \u0027this\u0027 or \u0027super\u0027 keyword:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[code]\nclass C : P {\n  C() : this(5){}\n  C(int i) : super(i){}\n}[code: end] Object is allocated in the heap area and therefore is always passed through references on the call stack. Assiging an object to another merely passes along the reference. The one prominent exception to this is for [String](String), which is copied by value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObject provides a bunch of basic methods with default implementations based on the underlying platform. This means these methods do not have to be implemented by the extending classes, but in certain circumstances such implementation is highly recommeded. manipulation. The original string instance always remain unchanged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Object is the root of class hierarchy, it\u0027s not the root of all types. All primitive types and [Any](Any) are not classes. Assigning Object values to primitive typed variables would usually result in illegal assignement exception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more detailed description on Object and typing system in general, see [Julian Tutorial].",
